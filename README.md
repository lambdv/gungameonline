## Getting Started
```bash
# Start the server
cd server/rust/gungameserver
cargo run

# Start the client
cd client
godot --path . --scene res://test/world/World.tscn
```

## Architecture
The frontend is built using Godot game engine which is a "view" into a player's representation of the game world and a "cache" of the player state on the server.
The server written in Rust is authorative for the game world and handles the logic for the game.

The server uses a ENETs UDP endpoint to handle packets for fast real-time gameplay such as player state synchronization or weapon firing.

HTTP endpoints are used for less speed critical operations such as lobby joining and creation.

Server state's state is a struct with a lock for thread safety when handling concurrent requests.
