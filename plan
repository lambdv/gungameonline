Game Logic Loop / Simulation Module Implementation Plan
Overview
This plan outlines implementing a server-side simulation module for the gun game that handles world/map representation, player entities, bullet physics, and collision detection. The simulation will run authoritatively on the server to ensure fair gameplay.
Core Components (High Priority)
1. World/Map Structure - Define 3D space with boundaries, static obstacles, and collision geometry
2. Bullet Physics - Implement projectile trajectory, lifetime management, and movement updates  
3. Collision Detection - Raycasting for bullets, bounding volumes for players/obstacles
4. Player Simulation - Position updates, health/weapon state, input processing
5. Game Loop - Fixed timestep updates with entity synchronization
Integration Components (Medium Priority)
6. Damage System - Health updates on collisions, integrate with existing Damageable class
7. Player Movement - Wall clipping prevention, terrain collision, boundary checking
8. Network Sync - Collision events, health updates, position corrections to clients
Optimization & Testing (Low-Medium Priority)
9. Performance - Spatial partitioning, entity culling, efficient collision queries
10. Testing - Unit tests for collision detection, integration tests for simulation loop
The implementation will be in Rust on the server-side, with synchronization to the Godot client. Each component builds on the existing Player and WeaponData models, extending the current simulator module.
